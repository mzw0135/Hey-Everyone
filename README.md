# Hey-Everyone

Auburn University's Hey Day is a cherished tradition that dates back to 1947. It was born out of a desire to create a sense of unity and belonging among students, particularly those who had returned from serving in World War II. Upon their return to campus, these students often felt overlooked and unheard, prompting the student body and the Student Government Association to initiate the concept of Hey Day.

The core idea behind Hey Day is simple yet powerful: every student, faculty member, and member of the Auburn Family wears a name tag on this special day. This tradition serves to break down barriers and foster a welcoming atmosphere where everyone can feel seen and appreciated. Hey Day has since become one of Auburn University's longest-standing and most beloved traditions, eagerly anticipated each year.

The 2023 Hey Day, scheduled for October 18, is set to continue this heartwarming tradition. Name tags will once again be distributed, encouraging the Auburn Family to engage in friendly greetings and interactions. Beyond the name tags, the celebration will take place all over campus and will include Hey Day-branded promotional items to enhance the sense of community.

The highlight of the event will be a festive gathering on the Campus Green. Attendees can look forward to a catered meal, a pep rally featuring the Auburn Cheerleaders, an inflatable obstacle course, and the presence of special guests. It promises to be a day of joy and togetherness, where students and staff alike can come together to strengthen their bonds with one another.
